## Description


## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository
* Open index.html in Terminal

## Known Bugs

* Clicking repeatedly on a standard pizza button or a sides order button shows the correct summation of the price to the Cart, but does not add more detailed links

## Specifications

The program should handle: | Example Input | Example Output
----- | ----- | -----
The program will determine the price of a custom pizza based on the options selected in the form | Custom Pizza Form: Size-Small, 10"; Sauce-Alfredo; Cheese-Cheese; Veggie 1-Onions; Veggie 2-Green Peppers; Meat-Sausage | $12
Once the user clicks the "Place Order" button on the custom pizza form, the total price of the custom order is shown in the Cart column, while the form refreshes | Cart: Price $, and user submits form for a small pizza with regular cheese | Cart: Price $12
The program will add $3 to the Cart price when a Sides button is clicked | Cart: Price $, and the user clicks the "Italian Soda" button | Cart: Price $3
When an item is added to the Cart column, a link with the general item name will appear | Cart, and user clicks on "Brownie" button | Cart: Sides
The links in the Cart column can be clicked on to view the details of the individual item order | Cart: Sides, and user clicks "Sides" text link | Cart: Sides - "3 garlic breadsticks"
For each item added to the Cart, the details will append in list form under the proper food category | Cart: Sides - "3 garlic breadsticks", and user clicks "Breadsticks" button   | Cart: Sides - "3 garlic breadsticks", :"3 garlic breadsticks"
